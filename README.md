## 🔬 Current Research

**Robust Impulse Control under Model Uncertainty**  
Proposing a stochastic impulse control framework where an investor optimally intervenes under drift ambiguity.  
Derived the HJB-QVI and explored both numerical methods and reinforcement learning to approximate optimal control policies.  
**Supported by the NMDSI Summer Research Award (2025)**
